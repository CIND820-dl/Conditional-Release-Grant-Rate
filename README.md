# Conditional Release Grant Rate
CIND820 – Big Data Analytics Project

Project Context

The Parole Board of Canada (PBC) is part of the criminal justice system in Canada. The PBC is an independent governmental agency that has “exclusive authority, under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA), to grant, deny, and revoke parole for offenders serving sentences of two years or more” (Parole Board of Canada, 2021). As described in the CCRA, the opportunity for conditional release is available to all offenders. However, although the opportunity exists, it is in no way guaranteed that the release will be granted. Conditional release allows the offender to serve the rest of their sentence in the community while under the supervision of the PRC (Parole Board of Canada, 2019). There are different types of conditional releases as defined in the CCRA. In order to determine whether an offender is eligible for release, the PBC must thoroughly assess the risk the offender poses to the community. By default, the PBC prioritizes the “protection of society” when considering any release decisions (Parole Board of Canada, 2021). 

As part of the Government of Canada’s open data initiative, the PRC publishes annually on the number of conditional releases by its final approved release decisions (i.e., granted, not granted etc.) (Parole Board of Canada, 2018). The dataset captures the following: year, month, jurisdiction, decision purpose, decision type, sentence type, review type, race, gender and offence type.

The following project is based on the “Conditional Release Grant Rate” data provided by the Parole Board of Canada (PBC).
The proposed project will be focusing on the theme of classification. The classification is method is suitable for this project because it seeks to understand the target variable (grant rate qualifier) and how the remaining variables can be used to predict the target variable. As offenders continue to move through the criminal justice system, there is value in understanding and predicting if an offender’s conditional release can be predicted. This project has two primary aims:
1.	Based on Singh, Jain and Kumar (2017)’s study, how do classifier algorithms such as decisions trees, neural networks and random forest compare when used to predict the grant rate qualifier? How do the results compare to those obtained in the Singh, Jain and Kumar study?
2.	How do each of three classifiers compare against one another in terms of efficiency, performance, and accuracy?
